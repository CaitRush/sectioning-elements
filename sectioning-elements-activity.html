      <p>Let me tell you about why pit bulls are the best:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>They love to be hugged and cuddled.</li>
        <li>They always put your safety first and will always bark at the mailman to protect you.</li>
        <li>They are not big shedders, and they are so loyal.</li>
        <li>There is a kiddo next to me. She is rad.</li>
